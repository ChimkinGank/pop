  <h1> <span style="color: #bf0040;"> 1. </span> Directed Lengths </h1>  
  <p> First, we are going to define directed lengths. If we say we are using directed lengths, then for any three collinear points $A$, $B$, $C$, the ratio $\frac{AB}{AC}$ is said to be $\frac{AB}{AC}$ if rays $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$ point in the same direction, and $-\frac{AB}{AC}$ otherwise. The same applies for products as well. A few pictures are shown below. Using directed lengths, find the ratios $\frac{XA}{XB}$ and $\frac{YA}{YB}$ in the diagram below. 
<img src="img1.png" class="center">
This hints to why these are useful as indeed, while the magnitudes of these ratios are the same, one is $2$ and the other is $-2$. The more explicit upshot of these is that given two points $A$, $B$ and a point $P$ lying on line $AB$, the statement $\frac{PA}{PB}$ does not actually tell you where $P$ is if you are not using directed lengths. Sure, it whittles it down to two points, but you do not know which one is $P$. If you use directed lengths, one is positive and one is negative, hence the ratio $\frac{PA}{PB}$ tells you <em>exactly</em> where $P$ is.
<h1> <span style="color: #bf0040;"> 2. </span> Power of a Point </h1>
Okay, now we can actually get into power of a point. <br><br>
<div class="theorem"> 
  <thm><b>Theorem 2.1 (Power of a Point)</b></thm><br>
  Let $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be points with $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting at $P$. Then $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are concyclic if and only if $PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$, <b>where the lengths are directed</b>. 
</div><br>
The lengths being directed essentially whittle it down to two configurations (as these are the only ones that actually "work"), as shown below.
<img src="img2.png" class="center">
<em>Proof.</em> Suppose the points are concyclic. We omit the directed lengths condition as $PA\cdot PB$ and $PC\cdot PD$ are both negative if $P$ is inside $(ABCD)$ and positive if $P$ is outside $(ABCD)$. Then $\angle PAC=\angle PDB$ (why?) so $\triangle PAC\sim \triangle PDB$, meaning $\frac{PA}{PC}=\frac{PD}{PB}\implies PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$, as desired.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise suppose $PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD\implies\frac{PA}{PC}=\frac{PD}{PB}$, and since $\angle APC=\angle DPB$, we have $\triangle PAC\sim\triangle PDB$, meaning $\angle PAC=\angle PDB$ so $ABCD$ is cyclic. <div style="float: right;"><div class="proof"> </div></div>
<br><br>
<div class="theorem"> 
  <thm><b>Definition 2.2</b></thm><br>
  Let $\omega$ be a circle centered at $O$ with radius $r$ and $P$ an arbitrary point. Then we define the <em>power</em> of $P$ with respect to $\omega$ as $\text{Pow}(P,\omega)=OP^2-r^2$. 
</div><br>
Sure, $\text{Pow}(P,\omega)=0$ if $P\in\omega$, but how is this useful? Consider the following.
<br><br>
<div class="theorem"> 
  <thm><b>Theorem 2.3</b></thm><br>
  Let $\omega$ be a circle and $P$ be an arbitrary point. If $A$ and $B$ are on $\omega$ such that $P$ is on line $AB$, then $\text{Pow}(P,\omega)=PA\cdot PB$, where lengths are directed. 
</div><br>
<em>Proof.</em> First, let us get rid of these annoying sign conditions. The power in both definitions is negative if $P$ is on the interior of $\omega$ and positive if $P$ is on the exterior of $\omega$ (why?) and are both $0$ if $P$ is on $\omega$ (as the "length" of a point is $0$). 
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, let $PO$ meet $\omega$ at $X$ and $Y$. A diagram is shown below. 
<img src="img3.png" class="center">
The key idea is to write $OP^2-r^2$ as $(PO-r)(PO+r)$ (or $(r-PO)(r+PO)$ if $P$ is on the interior of $\omega$), from where these values are just $PX$ and $PY$, so $OP^2-r^2=PX\cdot PY=PA\cdot PB$ by <span style="color: #0b0bff;">Theorem 2.1</span>, as desired.
<div style="float: right;"><div class="proof"> </div></div>
<br><br>
Note that this encapsulates part of <span style="color: #0b0bff;">Theorem 2.1</span> as now for any four points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ on one circle $\omega$ and arbitrary point $P$, $PA\cdot PB=\text{Pow}(P,\omega)=PC\cdot PD$.
